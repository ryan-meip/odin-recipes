    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Found this recipe online and tweaked it a little to make it "more orangey." It's very easy and so good! The scones come out with a wonderful texture.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ stick cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons orange zest</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons orange juice</li>
        <li>1 medium egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Glaze</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons orange juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter using a pastry cutter. Mix in orange zest.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Whisk orange juice, egg, and vinegar together and pour into the flour mixture. Stir until moistened and sticky.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface and knead gently about 10 times. Pat into a 6x8-inch rectangle. Cut rectangle into 4 squares; cut each square diagonally into 8 triangles. Arrange scones on the prepared baking sheet. Brush tops with milk and sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the orange glaze while the scones are baking. Mix 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar and orange juice until thick and smooth; glaze should drip slowly off the back of a spoon. Mix in orange zest.</li>
